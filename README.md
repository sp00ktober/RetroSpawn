# RetroSpawn
Mod for the game "Starsand" which just came out on steam in early access.
## What does it do?
This mod gives you the old Scolo spawning from version 0.5.2 with a tiny bit from 0.5.3, meaning:

- 1 base Scolo at day <= 5
- 2 base Scolos at day <= 15
- 3 base Scolos at day <= 30
- 4 base Scolos at day <= 45
- 5 base Scolos at day > 45

Additionally you get 1 extra Scolo spawned for each time you have the earth quake at the same location as the last time.
I also removed the stack protection introduced in version 0.5.3 of the game, so if you dont kill the Scolos you can end up with massive amounts of them after a few days.

## How does it work?
### Using a Mod Manager
Install either [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) or [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) and install the mod from there.
